## Log

### DAY1 - SEP 1st 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the first day of 100daysofcode doing Freecodecamp challenges. Had some basic sections remaining from 'Introduction to HTML & HTML5' and 'Basic CSS' which was completed. After that started the "Applied Visual Design' section.

### DAY2 - SEP 2nd 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today worked of transform, animations and keyframes from applied visual Design. Those challenges were awesome. I has created a heart kind of shapes using transform and animated the divisions using keyframes. 

### DAY3 - SEP 3nd 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have completed the challenges which were remaining in the 'Applied Visual Design'. After that, I have started 'Applied Accessibility' were I have learned how to make screen readers easily to read on pages. The final thing is that each page should have only(and one only) h1 element, which is the main subject of that page content. This is very helpful for search engines to understand the topic of the page.

### DAY4 - SEP 4th 2018

**Today's Progress** I have completed 'Applied Accessibility' challenges today. Tomorrow planning to start 'Responsive Web Desing principles'.
